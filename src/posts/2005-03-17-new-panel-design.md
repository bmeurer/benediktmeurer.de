<a href="http://xfce.loculus.nl/">Jasper</a> decided to open the <a href="http://www.myoo.de/xfce/index.php/Panel_Design">design process</a> for the new panel for general discussion. He's using the <a href="http://www.myoo.de/xfce/index.php/Main_Page">Xfce Wiki</a> for this purpose. The most important part is the Panel Plugin API. So, in case you are a panel plugin writer or plan to write a plugin in the future, I suggest you enter the discussion.

Jasper presented his ideas for the new Panel at FOSDEM 2005 (<a href="http://xfce.loculus.nl/FOSDEM/">slides available</a>).
