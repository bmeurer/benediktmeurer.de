So I added the firefox-like location bar to Thunar today (<a href="/2005/03/17/thunar-open-location-ideas">Brian Schott came up with that idea</a> yesterday) and after playing around with it for some time, I'm pretty sure that this is the solution to the location bar problem we've been trying to find during the last weeks.

 </li>
</ul>

It's just great, you can navigate using the keyboard, but the location entry widget isn't visible until you need it. This is great for newbies and power users, as it combines the best of both worlds: Newbies will use the path bar and the shortcuts for mostly everything, while power users can easily enter paths if necessary.
