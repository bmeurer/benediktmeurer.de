Today I read a very interesting article on how to [turn your BSD box into a powerful multimedia
workstation](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2002/09/05/FreeBSD_Basics.html). Although it was
written with FreeBSD in mind, it might also be useful to read for a NetBSD user interested in
enjoying multimedia on its NetBSD machine.

The [September Issue of Daemon News on-line E-zine](http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200209/) includes
a small Q&A guide on [how to properly partition a disk for
NetBSD](http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200209/diskpartnbsd.html) written by Grey Wolf.
