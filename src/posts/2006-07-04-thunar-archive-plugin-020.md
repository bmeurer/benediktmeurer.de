This is a major release, which introduces a generic scripting interface for archivers, so the plugin can now be used with basicly every archive manager that supports the required command line parameters. Support for File Roller (the GNOME archive manager) and Ark (the KDE archive manager) is builtin. <a href="http://xarchiver.xfce.org/">Xarchiver</a> will include support for the archive plugin in the next release. It depends on <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/">Thunar</a> 0.2.2 or above.
