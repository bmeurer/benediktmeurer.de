<a href="http://os-cillation.com/">os-cillation</a> now offers an <a href="http://www.os-cillation.com/article.php?sid=50">embedded linux platform</a> with Xfce as graphical interface for control units, appliances and other embedded applications. The system boots from a flash file system, which can be customized to fit the customers needs. The system itself offers 4 RS232 ports, 4 USB ports, 1 IrDA port and up to 16 GPIO pins, which makes it well suited for system control in the industry.

Once again Xfce demonstrates its power as all-around desktop, which also supports small setups, like embedded systems, very well.
