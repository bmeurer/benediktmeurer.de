I just uploaded new Debian packages to the <a href="http://os-works.com/view/debian/">os-cillation repository</a>, including the update to Xfce 4.2.1, the new Xfmedia 0.7.0 release and a few goodies. In addition the <tt>xfld-desktop</tt> package does no longer depend on <tt>xnetcardconfig</tt>, which enables Ubuntu users to easily install xfld-desktop now.
