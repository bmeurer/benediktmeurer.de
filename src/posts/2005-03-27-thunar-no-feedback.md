Looks like Thunar does not attract software developers (yet), at least they did not respond to my last mail to thunar-dev. Somehow it looks like we got a bunch of users and hackers hanging around on the mailinglist and waiting for code or mockups to play with, which is fun of course; but we need more <b>dev</b> activitity on the <b>dev</b> mailinglist. ;-)
