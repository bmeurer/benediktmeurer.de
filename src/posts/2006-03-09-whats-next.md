Thunar will enter beta phase soon, so I thought I'd share two additional screenshots of what's to come soon.

First, Thunar finally supports DnD to shortcuts (after crashing Thunar and Nautilus several times while testing, but finally remembered to remove `GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL`). <a href="/images/2006/thunar-shortcuts-dnd.png">Screenshot</a>

Next, I started work on the tree view. The basic tree view and tree model took less than a day, pretty easy using <code>GNode</code>. But I guess it'll take another week to add all the small details. <a href="/images/2006/thunar-tree-view.png">Screenshot</a>
