One wouldn't imagine how difficult it can be to copy/move files around. You can come up with <code>cp</code>/<code>mv</code> hacks within a few minutes. But doing it right, with user interaction, trash support, percentage/EST calculation and all the good stuff (threaded of course, and esp. without risking data loss on the user's side), seems to be surprisingly difficult. I guess it's time to stand up from the computer and do something else.

In other news, there's <a href="http://www.xfce.org/~korbinus/">Mickael</a> posting about <i>Xfce is KDE done the right way</i>, based on <a href="http://www.loculus.nl/gallery/xfce/20050718_G">one of Jaspers screenshots</a>: I doubt that Xfce will ever attract the average KDE user. There ain't enough bells and whistles in Xfce, or - to quote a colleague - <i>Xfce just works</i>. KDE users are a bit like Mac Classic users: It doesn't matter that much if something doesn't work properly (they'll figure out how to ignore the problem), but everything must be cute and cuddly. And personally, I wouldn't want to see Xfce turning into that direction.
