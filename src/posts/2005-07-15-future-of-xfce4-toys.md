I just removed xfce4-tips from the xfce4-toys package, since it's now included with xfce4-session. Now the question is: Where to move the eyes plugin to (which is the only component left in xfce4-toys)? We have basicly three options:

<ul><li>Move it to xfce4-panel</li><li>Turn it into a separate goodie</li><li>Drop it (if Danny do not want to maintain it anymore)</li></ul>
