title: My take on the "Google Manifesto"
tags: thoughts
---

In the past couple of days there's been lots of discussions and ramblings around the so-called
[_Google Manifesto_](http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320),
and what it means for the tech industry, and maybe the world as a whole. I **strongly and wholeheartedly
disagree** with what's being said in that document, and I realize that not stating this publicly doesn't
help anyone! I don't believe that inherent psychological or biological differences may explain why we don't
see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.

In fact, I have strong evidence that women are at least as capable as men working in our industry and
solving challenging problems at large scale. I'm glad to work on the same team with top software engineers
like [Marja Hölttä](https://twitter.com/marjakh) and [Franziska Hinkelmann](https://twitter.com/fhinkel),
and in the same organization as some of my idols like [Parisa Tabriz](https://twitter.com/laparisa),
hacking on products that are being used by more than two billion people daily! And just as I write these lines,
I'm hosting a female SWE intern working on fundamental changes to the
[`Deoptimizer`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/deoptimizer.h) in V8, one of the most complex
parts of the engine!

So to all women in tech: Thanks for being with us! Don't give up! We gotta find ways to fix this mess. Together.
