I just released Thunar-0.2.2alpha2 and libexo-0.3.1.4alpha2. As suggested by the name, it is an alpha release and it is thereby considered to be more or less stable in what it does, but it is by no means a final version.

You'll need atleast libxfce4util 4.2.2, Gtk+ 2.6.4, shared-mime-info 0.15 and desktop-file-utils 0.10 to build and run Thunar. In addition, Gamin or FAM are highly suggested to enable file system monitoring in Thunar. For HAL support on Linux, the libhal-storage devel package is required (0.5.0 or above). The <code>README</code> file contains a complete list of dependencies and optional packages.

The official announcement is available at: <http://thunar.xfce.org/news.html#2006-03-05>

Additional (updated) screenshots are available at: <http://thunar.xfce.org/screenshots.html>

The source tarballs can be downloaded from: <http://thunar.xfce.org/download.html#0.2.2>
