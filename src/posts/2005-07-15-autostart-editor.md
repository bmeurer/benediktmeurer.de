Since we're now using desktop files instead of arbitrary scripts or symlinks, it is pretty easy to make the list of autostarted applications editable through a simple user interface. And so here's <code>xfce4-autostart-editor</code>:

<code>xfce4-autostart-editor</code> is now part of <code>xfce4-session</code> (trunk, rev 16232). I'm looking for an icon - or atleast an idea about how such an icon could look like - for this tool (unfortunately Francois is away).
