I just released Thunar-0.3.0beta1 and libexo-0.3.1.6beta1 as part of <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> 4.4BETA1 (separate tarballs are provided for users of Xfce 4.2.x that don't want to upgrade yet, and users of other desktop environments). As suggested by the name, it is a beta release and it is thereby considered to be more or less stable in what it does, but it is still not a final version.

You will need atleast libxfce4util 4.2.2, GTK+ 2.6.4, shared-mime-info 0.15 and desktop-file-utils 0.10 to build and run Thunar. In addition Gamin or FAM are highly recommended to enable file system monitoring in Thunar. For HAL support on Linux, the libhal-storage-devel package is required (0.5.0 or above). The <code>README</code> file contains a complete list of dependencies and optional packages.

The official announcement is available at: <http://thunar.xfce.org/news.html#2006-04-16>
