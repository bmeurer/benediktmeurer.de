I finally committed the drop-site support for the current views in Thunar (the icon and details view). I stumbled over a few oddities in the GtkDnD code that I have never noticed before, and the current code in Thunar is not yet perfect, as some things don't work properly (or don't work as expected) right now. For example, you can drag a file in nautilus and drop it on a Thunar view, but you cannot drag a file in Thunar and drop it in a nautilus view, odd.

In other news, we're close to hitting the current thread-length-record on <a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/thunar-dev">thunar-dev</a> with <a href="http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/thunar-dev/2005-August/001041.html">another</a> <a href="http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/thunar-dev/2005-September/001085.html">website</a> discussion. In short: <a href="http://home.quicknet.nl/qn/prive/nickschermer/">This</a> is how the Thunar website will most probably look like.
