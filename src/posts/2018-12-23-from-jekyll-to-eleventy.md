I've been happily using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator for [this website](/)
for almost 7¬Ω years now, initially motivated by the excellent [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
service. Jekyll is awesome, since it gets you started easily without a lot of worrying about how to
setup lot's of different things.

But during the last month or so, [Mathias](https://mths.be) managed to convince me, that it makes
sense to dogfood our own software and the ecosystem around it - meaning it makes sense to look into
JavaScript based solutions. To be honest, I always felt like I should know more about how developers
use JavaScript first-hand. So I decided to give [eleventy](https://11ty.io) a try, which is also used
for the new [v8.dev](https://v8.dev) website.

I've been playing around with [eleventy](https://11ty.io) for about ten days now, and so far I'm quite
happy. It's not as well established as Jekyll, but it's fun to learn some basics of web development
and specifically JavaScript in the wild. The source code for my new website is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bmeurer/benediktmeurer.de) like before, although it's no longer hosted on
GitHub Pages, but using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) right now. It's probably a bit overengineered
(i.e. using [gulp](https://gulpjs.com), which is not strictly necessary), but as said, I'm using this
to learn more about JavaScript land. üòÅ
