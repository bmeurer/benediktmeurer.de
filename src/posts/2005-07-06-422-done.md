uhm, I shouldn't be awake. Nah, whatever. Updated all packages to 4.2.2. Not sure about the <code>xffm4</code> package, I think Edscott changed something, but I'm not in favour of figuring out what it was right now. The package looks ok in that <code>xffm</code> still starts. Drop me a note if something broke. Also noticed that Erik released mousepad 0.2.2 some time ago - why did nobody tell me? - and the <code>mousepad</code> package is also updated now. By the way, mousepad is really a very bad name. Try goggling for mousepad and you'll know why. ;-)
