WebsiteCompressor is a small, fast and very easy to use Java utility that minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML files by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in size and load faster.

Under the hood it utilizes the famous [HtmlCompressor](http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/) to minify HTML and XML files and Yahoo!'s [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) to minify CSS and JavaScript files (and optionally also minify inline CSS and JavaScript in HTML files).

### Example

For example, use the following commands to minify a website generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the WebsiteCompressor (assuming that you placed the JAR files in a subdirectory named `_lib`, which is then ignored by Jekyll):

```
cd /path/to/website
jekyll --no-server
java -jar _lib/websitecompressor-{{ version }}.jar --compress-css --compress-js _site
```

Afterwards upload the contents of the `_site` folder to your webserver as usual.

### Warning

WebsiteCompressor performs all compression in-place, so do not run WebsiteCompressor on your original source files! Create a copy of your website files first, run WebsiteCompressor on the copy and upload it to your webserver afterwards.
