    The ES2015 revision of JavaScript introduced Promises as primitives for asynchronous operations and generators as primitives for concurrent programming.

    On top of that ES2017/18 added async functions and generators. This talk briefly explores these primitives, and dives into the performance peculiarities of Promises-based programming paradigms. Weâ€™ll especially look into how these operations perform in V8, the JavaScript engine that powers both Node.js and Chrome.
