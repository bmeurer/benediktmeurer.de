<h3><a href="/ocaml-experimental/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ocaml-experimental</a></h3>

<p>
  The <a href="/ocaml-experimental/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ocaml-experimental</a> project serves as a playground for
  experimenting with new features and changes to the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">OCaml</a>
  language and runtime, including a new <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1029" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">native code toplevel</a>

  <a href="/BMKit/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">BMKit</a> is a collection of various useful Objective-C classes
  and categories for iOS (and Mac) development. It is always <i>work-in-progress</i> as I constantly
  add new features as needed. BMKit is designed to be embedded into other Xcode projects, see
  the <a href="/BMKit/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">project website</a> for details.

<h3><a href="/websitecompressor/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebsiteCompressor</a></h3>

<p>
  <a href="/websitecompressor/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebsiteCompressor</a> is a small, fast and very
  easy to use Java utility that minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML
  files by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the
  content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in size and load faster.

<h3><a href="/iFlashLightPlus/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a></h3>

<p>
  <a href="/iFlashLightPlus/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="iFlashLight+" src="/images/iflashlightplus.png" /></a>
  With <a href="/iFlashLightPlus" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> you can turn
  your smart phone into a flash light using the
  LED light on the iPhone 4. The camera LED flash on the iPhone 4 is mega bright
  and when turned on in a constant stream, it is unrivaled in terms of lighting
  power.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote <a href="/iFlashLightPlus" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> when I received
  my brand new iPhone 4 and discovered that all available iPhone 4 LED flash light apps
  sucked for some reason (ads, malware, crashes, etc.). <a href="/iFlashLightPlus"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> is free and <a href="http://github.com/bmeurer/FlashLight"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">open source</a>, and - unlike other flash light apps - comes without
  ads and malware.

  in a central location and use them for your Git repositories.
</p>


<h3><a href="/git-utils/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">git-utils</a></h3>

<p>
  <a href="/git-utils/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">git-utils</a> is a collection of simple utilities that made
  my Git life easier in some way or another. I tried to clean them up as much as necessary prior to
  putting here, so it should be easy to use for others as well.

  <a href="http://xfce.org/projects/thunar" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Thunar</a> is a project I started in
  mid 2004 (initially named Filer, but renamed to Thunar, because of a name clash with Jens' <a
  href="http://filer.foo-projects.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Perl Filer</a>), which aims at developing
  an easy to use, lightweight file manager for the Unix/Linux desktop (specifically the <a
  href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce Desktop Environment</a>).

<h3><a href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a></h3>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Xfce desktop environment" src="/images/xfce.png" /></a>
  Over the last years I wrote various bits and pieces of the <a href="http://xfce.org"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a>. I developed and maintained various core parts of the
  <a href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a>, including the new file
  manager <a href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Thunar</a>, which I wrote from scratch to
  replace the unpopular <a href="http://xffm.sourceforge.net" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xffm</a> file manager,
  the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfce4-session" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Session Manager</a>,

<h3><a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce developer tools (xfce4-dev-tools)</a></h3>

<p>
  The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce developer tools</a> provide a collection of scripts and M4 macros that
  are required to build the <a href="http://xfce.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Xfce</a> core desktop
  components and various other software packages straight from SVN/CVS. You do not need the
  developer tools if you are building from the release tarballs.
</p>


<h3><a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/upidiff/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">UPiDiff</a></h3>

<p>
  The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/upidiff/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">UPiDiff</a> tool
  was developed as part of a hands-on training at the <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Siegen</a> back in 2003. It was renamed since then and is now known
  as <a href="http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/sidiff/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SiDiff</a>. Its constantly
  extended with new features every year, but unfortunately it's one of those University projects that
  doesn't attract external developers because there's no real way to get involved.
</p>


<h3><a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/tpml" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">TPML</a></h3>

<p>
  The <a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/tpml" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">TPML</a> tool
  was developed as part of an university project at the <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Siegen</a> from 2005 to 2009. Its purpose is to help students
  understand the semantics of programming languages and the related type theory.
