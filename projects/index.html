  Below is a brief (yet incomplete) list of open source and free software
  projects where I am involved or to which I have contributed a significant
  amount of code. You might also want to check my <a
  href="http://github.com/{{ site.github }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a
  href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/bmeurer" target="_blank">ohloh</a> pages.

  <a href="/PhotoAccess/" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="PhotoAccess" src="/images/photoaccess.png" style="margin-right:30px; margin-top:7px;" /></a>
  With <a href="/PhotoAccess/" target="_blank">PhotoAccess</a> you can easily transfer photos directly
  from your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to any computer using a web browser over WiFi. Select an existing
  photo or take a new picture, and PhotoAccess will display a download URL below the photo. Enter that
  URL in a web browser on any computer on the same network and you can download the full resolution
  photo, rotated to the correct orientation. The perfect solution to transfer just that one photo which
  you need right now.

<h2><a href="/BMKit/" target="_blank">BMKit</a></h2>

<p>
  <a href="/BMKit/" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="BMKit" src="/images/ios-static-library.png" style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:5px;" /></a>
  <a href="/BMKit/" target="_blank">BMKit</a> is a collection of various useful Objective-C classes
  and categories for iOS (and Mac) development. It is always <i>work-in-progress</i> as I constantly
  add new features as needed. BMKit is designed to be embedded into other Xcode projects, see
  the <a href="/BMKit/" target="_blank">project website</a> for details.

<h2><a href="/websitecompressor/" target="_blank">WebsiteCompressor</a></h2>

<p>
  <a href="/websitecompressor/" target="_blank">WebsiteCompressor</a> is a small, fast and very
  easy to use Java utility that minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML
  files by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the
  content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in size and load faster.

<h2><a href="/iFlashLightPlus/" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a></h2>

<p>
  <a href="/iFlashLightPlus/" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="iFlashLight+" src="/images/iflashlightplus.png" style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:5px;" /></a>
  With <a href="/iFlashLightPlus" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> you can turn
  your smart phone into a flash light using the
  LED light on the iPhone 4. The camera LED flash on the iPhone 4 is mega bright
  and when turned on in a constant stream, it is unrivaled in terms of lighting
  power.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote <a href="/iFlashLightPlus" target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> when I received
  my brand new iPhone 4 and discovered that all available iPhone 4 LED flash light apps
  sucked for some reason (ads, malware, crashes, etc.). <a href="/iFlashLightPlus"
  target="_blank">iFlashLight+</a> is free and <a href="http://github.com/bmeurer/FlashLight"
  target="_blank">open source</a>, and - unlike other flash light apps - comes without
  ads and malware.

<h2><a href="/git-hooks/" target="_blank">git-hooks</a></h2>

<p>
  <a href="/git-hooks/" target="_blank">git-hooks</a> provides a simple mechanism to manage hooks
  for several Git repositories in a unified and simple way. It allows you to install hook scripts
  in a central location and use them for your Git repositories.
</p>


<h2><a href="/git-utils/" target="_blank">git-utils</a></h2>

<p>
  <a href="/git-utils/" target="_blank">git-utils</a> is a collection of simple utilities that made
  my Git life easier in some way or another. I tried to clean them up as much as necessary prior to
  putting here, so it should be easy to use for others as well.

<p>

  <a href="http://xfce.org/projects/thunar" target="_blank">Thunar</a> is a project I started in
  mid 2004 (initially named Filer, but renamed to Thunar, because of a name clash with Jens' <a
  href="http://filer.foo-projects.org/" target="_blank">Perl Filer</a>), which aims at developing
  an easy to use, lightweight file manager for the Unix/Linux desktop (specifically the <a
  href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce Desktop Environment</a>).
</p> 


<h2><a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/thunar-volman/" target="_blank">Thunar Volume Manager (thunar-volman)</a></h2>
 
<p> 
  The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/thunar-volman/" target="_blank">Thunar Volume
  Manager</a> provides automatic management of removable drives and media for the the <a
  href="http://xfce.org/projects/thunar" target="_blank">Thunar</a> file manager, without adding
  another daemon to the users desktop.

<h2><a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin" target="_blank">Thunar Archive Plugin (thunar-archive-plugin)</a></h2>

<p> 
  The <a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin"
  target="_blank">Thunar Archive Plugin</a> is a very simple plugin for the <a
  href="http://xfce.org/projects/thunar" target="_blank">Thunar</a> file manager, which
  allows users to create and extract archive files (i.e. <code>.tar.gz</code> and
  <code>.zip</code> files) from within Thunar, using the context menu.
</p>


<h2><a href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a></h2>

  <a href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Xfce desktop environment" src="/images/xfce.png" style="margin-right:30px; margin-top:7px;" /></a>
  Over the last years I wrote various bits and pieces of the <a href="http://xfce.org"
  target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a>. I developed and maintained various core parts of the
  <a href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce desktop environment</a>, including the new file
  manager <a href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_blank">Thunar</a>, which I wrote from scratch to
  replace the unpopular <a href="http://xffm.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Xffm</a> file manager,
  the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfce4-session" target="_blank">Session Manager</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/libxfce4" target="_blank">Xfce Libraries</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/terminal" target="_blank">Terminal</a>,
  innumerable plugins and goodies, and several other core components.

<h2><a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/" target="_blank">Xfce developer tools (xfce4-dev-tools)</a></h2>
 
<p> 
  The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/"
  target="_blank">Xfce developer tools</a> provide a collection of scripts and M4 macros that
  are required to build the <a href="http://xfce.org/" target="_blank">Xfce</a> core desktop
  components and various other software packages straight from SVN/CVS. You do not need the
  developer tools if you are building from the release tarballs.
</p>


<h2><a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/upidiff/" target="_blank">UPiDiff</a></h2>
 
<p> 
  The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/upidiff/" target="_blank">UPiDiff</a> tool
  was developed as part of a hands-on training at the <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de"
  target="_blank">University of Siegen</a> back in 2003. It was renamed since then and is now known
  as <a href="http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/sidiff/" target="_blank">SiDiff</a>. Its constantly
  extended with new features every year, but unfortunately it's one of those University projects that
  doesn't attract external developers because there's no real way to get involved.
</p> 


<h2><a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/tpml" target="_blank">TPML</a></h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/tpml" target="_blank">TPML</a> tool
  was developed as part of an university project at the <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de"
  target="_blank">University of Siegen</a> from 2005 to 2009. Its purpose is to help students
  understand the semantics of programming languages and the related type theory.
