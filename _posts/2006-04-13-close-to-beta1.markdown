We're close to Thunar BETA1, hopefully this weekend. So, time to share a few screenshots. The BETA1 includes a full-featured tree pane...

...allows to customize the columns in the detailed list view and provides a fixed column width mode, which does not only improve the usability for users used to the Window Explorer way, but also speeds up the display of the detailed list view by a factor of 10 for medium sized folders...

...includes improved single-click navigation support with configurable hover selection...

...and will work properly on Solaris out-of-the-box (with support for Solaris specific file types), though the Solaris volume management support will not be merged for the BETA1, as it's not ready for prime-time yet...

...and as additional goodie, the bulk renamer was imported, which allows users to easily rename multiple files at once.

Together with the additional <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/plugins.html">plugins</a>, and especially Jannis' <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/plugins.html#thunar-media-tags-plugin">thunar-media-tags-plugin</a>, a lot of bugfixes and usability improvements, and other changes I forgot to mention, we're already very close to the first final release.
