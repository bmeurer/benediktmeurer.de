title: OCamlJIT 2.0
---

OCamlJit 2.0 is a new Just-In-Time engine for Objective Caml 3.12.0 on desktop processors
(x86/x86-64). It translates the OCaml byte-code used by the interpreter (`ocamlrun` and `ocaml`)
to x86/x86-64 native code on-demand and runs the generated native code instead of interpreting
the byte-code. It is designed to run with minimal compilation overhead (translating only what
is being executed, avoiding costly code generation and optimization techniques), while being
100% compatible with the byte-code runtime (including serialization and hashing of closures,
etc.).  

OCamlJit 2.0 was specifically designed for desktop processors and is not really portable to
anything else in its current shape, because the target audience are people using the interactive
top-level and the byte-code interpreter for rapid prototyping/development (which is unlikely to
happen on anything else but x86/x86-64). The implementation currently requires a system that
adheres to the SysV ABI, which includes Linux, BSD, OS X, but excludes Win32/Win64
(patches/ideas are welcome). It was tested on Linux/x86 (Debian), Linux/amd64 (CentOS) and Mac
OS X 10.6 (64bit). The x86 implementation requires SSE2 capable processors (otherwise it falls
back to the byte-code interpreter), so it won't speedup your OCaml programs running on
486 CPUs. :-)

OCamlJit 2.0 runs most benchmarks at 2-6 times faster than the byte-code interpreter. The
interactive top-level benefits twice when used with the JIT engine:

1. the compiler stages are JIT compiled and
2. the generated byte-code is JIT compiled.

A tech report describing a slightly earlier prototype and including performance measures of
OCamlJit 2.0 on Mac OS X (64bit) is available at:

[http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1783](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1783)

The source code is available from the Git repository (master branch) at:

* [http://gitorious.org/ocamljit2/ocamljit2](http://gitorious.org/ocamljit2/ocamljit2)
* [http://github.com/bmeurer/ocamljit2](http://github.com/bmeurer/ocamljit2)

Installation is similar to installation of Objective Caml, just run

```
$ ./configure -prefix /path/to/ocamljit2 [options]
```

followed by

```
$ make world opt
$ make install
```

This will install a fully working Objective Caml 3.12.0 to `/path/to/ocamljit2`, where
`/path/to/ocamljit2/bin/ocamlrun` and `/path/to/ocamljit2/lib/libcamlrun_shared.so` include
the JIT engine in addition to the byte-code interpreter (fallback to the byte-code interpreter
is necessary for debugging with `ocamldebug`). The `configure` script prints a line indicating
whether the JIT engine is enabled or not (if not, it'll be just a regular OCaml 3.12
installation).

### Update

See the [discussion](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2010/11/7d46cc65289d9b9def4f7ff4e2e6258a.en.html) on the [Caml mailing list](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/index.en.html), and the more [recent work](/2010/11/30/ocamljit2-vs-ocamljit) on OCamlJIT2.
