title: Xfce 4.2.1.1 available
---

Since 4.2.1 contained <a href="/2005/03/17/critical-bug-in-xfce4-panel-421">this critical panel bug</a>, we did a quick 4.2.1.1 release yesterday, which fixes the panel issue.  All users of Xfce 4.2.1 should upgrade to 4.2.1.1. Updated installers are available from <a href="http://xfce-installers.os-cillation.com/">Xfce installers</a> website.
