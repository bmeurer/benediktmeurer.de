title: Thunar Location Bar vs. Path Bar
---

We are currently discussing the <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/">Thunar</a> User Interface:

On the one hand, we have the traditional location bar approach, which looks pretty similar to navigational Nautilus:

On the other hand, we have the new path bar approach, which looks pretty similar to the GtkFileChooser User Interface:

<a href="/images/2005/20050316-thunar-pathbar.png"><img src="/images/2005/20050316-thunar-pathbar.png" width="90%" /></a>

I tend to prefer the path bar approach...
