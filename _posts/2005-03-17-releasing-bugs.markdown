title: Releasing bugs...

Funny, right after the 4.2.1 release is finally done - well, except for Olivier's <code>ChangeLog</code>/<code>NEWS</code> - somebody files a critical <a href="http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=837">bugreport</a> against xfce4-session 4.2.0: xfce4-session - the simple and balou engines to be exact - crashes on startup with new freetype2 2.1.10cvs (well, not surprising that mice doesn't crash, as it doesn't render any text). Looks like a 4.2.2 release is not far away...
