... my favourite Linux based operating system, [Debian](http://www.debian.org). The mighty and outstanding Debian people finally came to the conclusion that it might be a good idea to release their software from time to time (sarge will become stable right after the Hurd 1.0 release). Oh, really. Why did noone think of this earlier?

But seriously... we suck at releasing our stuff... but hey, we *do release* it. And people like it - well except the few with the broken panel config. ;-)

On a related note: I did an Ubuntu intall recently on one of our new servers (Fujitsu Siemens Primergy 200) at work; the installation went very smooth. Ubuntu just works. No need for endless googling about stupid problems. No need to compile a custom kernel, as the Ubuntu default kernels support even high-end hardware out of the box. Many people say "Xfce is Gnome done right". I say "Ubuntu is Debian done right".
