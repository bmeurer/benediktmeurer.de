<a href="http://blog.xfce.org/index.php?p=85">Jasper</a>: I also read that articles, and they are indeed very good. Especially the number 8 on <a href="http://www.icefox.net/articles/kdeosx.php">Ben's list</a> is really a very good idea. It'd be just great to have something like Preview for Xfce/Gnome. Maybe Evince could turn into something like this.
