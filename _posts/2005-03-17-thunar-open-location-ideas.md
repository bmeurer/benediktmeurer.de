Brian Schott came up with a new - actually borrowed from ROX - idea for an Open Location control in the GtkFileChooser-like UI:

Here we'd have a fast and easy way to jump to a different location wihout the need to popup a separate dialog.

My original attempt (and that's how it's currently implemented in the prototype) was to have a separate Open Location dialog:

See the <a href="http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/thunar-dev/2005-March/000266.html">thread</a> on the mailinglist for the discussion concerning these ideas.
