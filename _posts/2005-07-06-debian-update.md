title: Debian update
---

Started to update the <a href="http://os-works.com/">os-cillation Debian packages</a> to 4.2.2. Ubuntu guys should sync these once done. Unfortunately that takes a lot of time. Need to reevaluate the idea of a Xfce debian team, so others can help in maintaining the packages. Shouldn't be a problem now that we have SVN setup on espresso with fine-grained access control. Need to discuss with Auke.
