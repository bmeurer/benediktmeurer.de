So, I decided that it's time to sum up the results of two/three weeks of Thunar UI discussion, and hacked it into a Wiki page:

<a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/wiki/ui:suggestion-20050320">http://thunar.xfce.org/wiki/ui:suggestion-20050320</a>

I think we can all agree on this suggestion, as it provides ease of use and simplicity with the default look (layout 1), but without limiting the user too much (something that has been complained about by Gnome users quite often lately), since the user is free to use a different look and feel (layout 2) or even customize the layout to fit his own needs. This is exactly the kind of flexibility we need for Xfce, and that's why people love Xfce: Put the user in control, but only to a certain degree. And of course, keep it lightweight and fast.
