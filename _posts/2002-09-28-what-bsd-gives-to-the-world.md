title: What BSD gives to the world

Today I read an interesting article on BSD and what it gave
(and still gives) to the world, you can find it <a
href="http://www.extremetech.com/print_article/0,3998,a=31573,00.asp">here</a>,
this is probably the best article about BSD, Unix and Linux, I ever
read. Also the changes to <a
href="http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?du+1+NetBSD-current">du(1)</a>
have been commited to NetBSD-current, so we'll get the long awaited feature with 1.7 ;-).
