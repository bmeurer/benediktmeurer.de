title: git-utils - Various git related utilities
---

[Git Utils](http://github.com/bmeurer/git-utils) is a collection of simple utilities that made
my [Git](http://git-scm.com) life easier in some way or another. I tried to clean them up as
much as necessary prior to putting here, so it should be easy to use for others as well.


## Installation

You don't need anything special, just a working installation of Git and a UNIX system (tested
with Mac OS X and Linux). To install the git-utils into <code>/usr/local</code> run

```
$ sudo make install
```

or just pick the scripts that you need and place them wherever you want.


## Description

### git-copy

Copy file from source path to target path and add the target path to the Git index.

### git-push-all

Invoke git-push for all configured remote repositories.
