title: Xfce Developer Tools 4.3.0
---

I should have done this a long time ago already, but anyways, here's xfce4-dev-tools 4.3.0. Download locations and installation instructions are available at

<a href="http://xfce.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/index.html">http://xfce.org/~benny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/index.html</a>

The guide isn't finished yet, and therefore neither in SVN nor in the tarballs.
