title: Thunar 0.4.0 and libexo 0.3.1.10 rc1 releases
---

I just released Thunar-0.4.0rc1 and libexo-0.3.1.10rc1 as part of <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> 4.4RC1. The separate tarballs are provided for users of Xfce 4.2.x that don't want to upgrade yet, and users of other desktop environments. As suggested by the name it is not yet a final release, but is considered to be somewhat stable.

You will need atleast libxfce4util 4.2.2, GTK+ 2.6.4, shared-mime-info 0.15 and desktop-file-utils 0.10 to build and run Thunar. In addition Gamin or FAM are highly recommended to enable file system monitoring in Thunar. For HAL support on Linux, the libhal-storage-devel package is required (0.5.0 or above). Furthermore if you want to use the trash panel applet, you will need the Xfce Panel 4.4BETA1 or above and D-Bus 0.34 or above. The <code>README</code> file contains a complete list of dependencies and optional packages.

The official announcement is available at: <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/news.html#2006-09-03">http://thunar.xfce.org/news.html#2006-09-03</a>
