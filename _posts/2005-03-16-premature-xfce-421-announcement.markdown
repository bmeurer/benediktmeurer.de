<a href="http://osnews.com/">OSNews</a> did it again today, but not only did they
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9989">announce</a> Xfce 4.2.1 before it was
officially released, this time they <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9983">did</a>
the same for KDE's 3.4 release. Neither <a href="http://xfce.org/">xfce.org</a> nor <a
href="http://kde.org/">kde.org</a> contained any mention of a new release at the time the
announcements where published on OSNews. In today's open source world, the most difficult part
of release engineering seems to be preventing news sites from announcing releases before they
actually happen, in order to get a smooth release. This worked amazingly well with the Xfce
4.2.0 release, but not before I mailed several news sites that they should not post anything
until they get an official notice.
