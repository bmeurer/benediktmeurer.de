Just uploaded my seminar paper on [PLTL Model
Checking](/files/modelchecking2007.pdf) toghether with the
[slides](/files/modelchecking2007-slides.pdf). The paper and the slides are
in german, and cover the basics of [Model
Checking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking) using Propositional
[Linear Temporal Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)
(PLTL).
