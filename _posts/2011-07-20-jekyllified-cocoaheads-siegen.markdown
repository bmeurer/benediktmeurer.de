title: Jekyllified CocoaHeads Siegen website
---

I just migrated the [CocoaHeads Siegen](http://cocoaheads.informatik.uni-siegen.de) website
to also use [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), and uploaded the source to
[GitHub](http://github.com/bmeurer/cocoaheads.informatik.uni-siegen.de) (it is not hosted
on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) though).

I've also uploaded the [slides and source
code](http://cocoaheads.informatik.uni-siegen.de/#2011-07-14) from the first CocoaHeads Siegen
meeting.
