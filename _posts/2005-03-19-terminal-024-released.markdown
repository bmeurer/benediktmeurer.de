title: Terminal 0.2.4 released
---

So I finally released the next version of <a href="http://terminal.os-cillation.com/">Terminal</a> after nearly 3 months since 0.2.2. And since everybody likes cute new features - as long as they don't blow up things too much - this new version finally includes support for helper applications (yes, that means clicking on URLs/email addresses is possible now):

This was about the most often requested feature. Several other changes have been made to improve Terminal. See the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?release_id=5079">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of user visible changes.

With this new release we're close to a 1.0 release, I think there'll be 0.2.6 and 0.2.8/0.3.0 before we jump to 1.0 though, as we've still some unresolved issues.
