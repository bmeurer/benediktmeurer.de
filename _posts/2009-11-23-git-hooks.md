[Git Hooks](http://github.com/bmeurer/git-hooks) provides a simple mechanism to manage hooks
for several [Git](http://git-scm.com) repositories in a unified and simple way. It allows you
to install hook scripts in a central location and use them for your Git repositories.


## Installation

You need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) and [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) in order to build and
install git-hooks. You will also need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com) and
[Perl](http://www.perl.org) installed for the hooks to work properly.  To build git-hooks run

```
$ cmake /path/to/git-hooks
$ make
```

in a new directory (preferably, tho you may also run it from the source
directory). Then, use

```
$ make install
```

to install git-hooks. This will install git-hooks to <code>/usr/local</code>. You can
use ccmake to change the installation prefix. Below, we will assume that you installed
git-hooks to <code>/usr/local</code>.


## Repository setup

To setup a repository using git-hooks, just use the repository template that ships with
git-hooks.

```
$ mkdir myrepo.git
$ cd myrepo.git
$ git --bare init --template=/usr/local/share/git-hooks/template ...
```

This will setup the new repository <code>myrepo.git</code> with git-hooks. Check the
sample config file that will be created for <code>myrepo.git</code>.


## Repository migration

To migrate an existing repository to use git-hooks, you should first backup
your existing hook scripts. Then replace the hooks with the ones from
<code>/usr/local/share/git-hooks/template/hooks</code>. Afterwards, you should migrate
your previous hook scripts to global hook scripts used by git-hooks.


## Configuration

The git-hooks package includes several useful hooks, which can be configured
to your needs using git config settings in your repository (or even global
settings from <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>). The
<code>/usr/local/share/git-hooks/template/config</code> file provides a sample
configuration file.

Please see the hook scripts in <code>/usr/local/share/git-hooks/*.d/</code> for the
various supported config settings.
