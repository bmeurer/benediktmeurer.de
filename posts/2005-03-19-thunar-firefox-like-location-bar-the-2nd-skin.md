Just came up with a better idea for the location bar layout:

<a href="/images/2005/20050319-thunar_go3.png"><img src="/images/2005/20050319-thunar_go3.png" width="99%" /></a>

It's now very similar to what Firefox does. The major difference is, that it's not associated with the statusbar as in Firefox, instead it's associated with the main view (icon/list view), which makes more sense.

It's important to have a user-visible way to get rid of the location bar again, even if there's already Escape or <code>focus-out</code>.
