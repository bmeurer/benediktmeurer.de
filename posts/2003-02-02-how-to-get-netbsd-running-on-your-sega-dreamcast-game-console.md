title: How to get NetBSD running on your Sega Dreamcast game console
---

Josh Tolbert &lt;<a href="mailto:hemi@puresimplicity.net">hemi at puresimplicity dot net</a>&gt; recently put together a lot of
stuff related to the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/dreamcast/">NetBSD/dreamcast</a> port and created an easy to install
NetBSD Dreamcast system along with a short introduction on how to
setup your Dreamcast and what need to be done to increase
the usuability of the NetBSD/dreamcast port (for now, focus on
<a href="http://www.tac.eu.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?wscons+4+NetBSD-current">wscons(4)</a> 
support for the Dreamcast framebuffer and getting POSIX threads to
work). Josh's How-To and all stuff needed to get NetBSD working on
your Dreamcast can found
<a href="http://www.puresimplicity.net/~hemi/dreamcast/">here</a>.
