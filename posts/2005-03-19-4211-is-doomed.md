I'm the new _wimp of the day_, as I accidently uploaded the wrong installer binary for 4.2.1.1 (I uploaded 4.2.1 *with* the panel bug again). I updated the mirrors now (except for www.us.xfce.org, www.xfce.org redirects to this mirror so don't download from xfce.org now, which will be updated during the next 3-4 hours) with the correct 4.2.1.1 binary, and everybody who installed 4.2.1.1 from the installer should refetch the <a href="http://os-cillation.de/download.php?file=xfce4-4.2.1.1-installer.bin">binary</a> and reinstall. Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this _doomed 4.2.1(.1) releases_.

## Update

Brian's comment on this was:
