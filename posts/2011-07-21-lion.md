So I'm trying to get used to [OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
now. One of the first things I noticed was that the <code>Library</code>
folder does no longer show up in Finder by default. Of course that was
rather trivial to fix using the following command:

```
chflags nohidden ~/Library
```

One really nice feature in Lion is that new tabs in
[Terminal.app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Terminal) now inherit the
current working directory from the tab from which they were opened - something
I implemented in [Xfce's Terminal](http://www.xfce.org/projects/terminal)
seven years ago, BTW. Looks like this is implemented by parsing the path
displayed in the title bar, which can have unexpected results when combined
with <code>ssh</code> sessions, since the path in the title is actually set
via the (remote) shell. In addition the title bar of Terminal windows
now provides the same handles as the title bar in Finder windows, which is
pretty handy.

Unfortunately Apple decided to kick Spaces and replace it with [Mission
Control](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html). This
by itself is not necessarily bad, but now there's no way to get that two
dimensional workspace layout back, at least until Apple decides
to fix that shortcoming. I've also noticed that the order of the workspaces
seems to change under some (obscure) conditions, which is even worse. Maybe
I'm just getting old, but until now I was unable to figure out what triggers
this rearrangement - not what I'd call intuitive.

**Update 1:** Lion also says *bye bye* to Microsoft Office for Mac 2004, since
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)">Rosetta</a> is not
available for Mac OS X 10.7.

**Update 2:** Make sure you don't miss the [Mac OS X 10.7 Lion
review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/)
by [ars technica](http://arstechnica.com)'s [John
Siracusa](http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/).

**Update 3:** Well, I am old... the fix for that *Mission Control feature* that
drove me nuts is obvious. In the **Mission Control** preference pane, disable
the **Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use** option. Even
if I was too blind to discover this earlier, it's nevertheless a really bad
default. Out of 100 Mac users, how many would their workspaces to rearrange
*magically*?
