It's wednesday already. Managed to finish my last math exam successfully this week and now I'm planning for my birthday party next saturday.

There's not much to tell from the Thunar front. I hope to have a release version ready by the end of the month, which will be imported into the Xfce SVN repository then, but no promises. Not sure if we can really release 4.4.0 this year, at least its questionable for Thunar. But on the other hand, that shouldn't be a problem, as long as we manage to release prior to 20060116. And dropping Thunar from Xfce 4.4.0 now that we told everybody that it will be included with 4.4 won't work.

As always, whats needed the most is time.
