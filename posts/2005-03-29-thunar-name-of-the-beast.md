title: Thunar - Name of the Beast?

The name discussion started once again. Most popular seems to be:
<ul>   <li>    Secretary   </li>   <li>    Nomad   </li>   <li>PathFinder</li>   <li>Digger
</li> </ul>for now. Personally, I still prefer Thunar for the reasons described in <a href="http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/thunar-dev/2005-March/000450.html">this mail</a>.

On a related note: Thunar was on <a href="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=10046">OSNews</a> already (why did nobody tell me?), and people commented on the <a href="/2005/03/20/thunar-suggestion-20050320">Suggestion 20050320</a>. I tried to get some useful information out of the comments, but it's hard to decide what's useful and what not (the slashdot syndrome). It'd be better if people would suggest/comment stuff on <a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/thunar-dev">thunar-dev</a> instead.
