Just like almost every other geek on this planet, I'm downloading
[OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) from the App Store right
now. Rather slow... but that way I can do a full backup first while
the update is downloading. [#lion](https://twitter.com/search/%23lion)
on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) is already busy discussing the new
release.

In related news: The new [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/)
looks really great - especially starting at $999. Finally a real alternative
to the [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/).
