I just released Thunar-0.5.0rc2 and libexo-0.3.1.12rc2 as part of Xfce 4.4RC2, which will be released in a few hours. The separate tarballs are provided for users of Xfce 4.2.x that don't want to upgrade yet, and users of other desktop environments. It is planned to be the last release candidate before the final release, so please help with testing so we can locate and elimate the leftover bugs for the final release.

You will need atleast libxfce4util 4.2.2, GTK+ 2.6.4, shared-mime-info 0.15 and desktop-file-utils 0.10 to build and run Thunar. In addition Gamin or FAM are highly recommended to enable file system monitoring in Thunar. For HAL support on Linux, the libhal-storage-devel package is required (0.5.0 or above). Furthermore if you want to use the trash panel applet, you will need the Xfce Panel 4.4BETA1 or above and D-Bus 0.34 or above. The <code>README</code> file contains a complete list of dependencies and optional packages.
