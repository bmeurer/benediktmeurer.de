<p> 
  Encrypted mail preferred. I sign most of my private emails with the <a
  href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_blank">GNU Privacy Guard</a>, an open source implementation of <a
  href="http://www.openpgp.org" target="_blank">OpenPGP</a>. If you want to contact me by email, you can
  download my public key <a href="/files/bmeurer.asc">here</a> or from the PGP keyservers.
  To retrieve my public key from a PGP keyserver and import it into your public key ring, open
  a shell and type the following command:
</p> 

{% highlight console %}
$ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-key B96891A2
{% endhighlight %}

<p> 
  For additional information, you should consult the manual shipped with your GnuPG distribution
  and visit the <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html" target="_blank">The GNU Privacy Guard Documentation</a>,
  where you can find the GNU Privacy Guard Handbook, which should be the first book to read,
  in order to get started with GnuPG.
