  <p>
    Make sure that PhotoAccess is actually running in the foreground. You cannot
    access the web interface while PhotoAccess is in the background.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure that you entered the correct URL, especially make sure that you
    did not forget the colon and the port (i.e. <code>:8080</code>). Also make
    sure that the computer from which you are trying to access the photos is on
    the same (WiFi) network as the iOS device running PhotoAccess.
  </p>
  <p>
    If all fails, try to reinstall PhotoAccess by removing it from your device
    and downloading it again from the App Store.

    The <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"
    href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/jul/15/app-developers-withdraw-us-patents">situation
    for iOS app developers</a> with respect to the US App Store is really bad right now. So instead of tilting
    at windmills we just keep our apps away from the US App Store until the US patent mess is fixed.

  <p>
    There are no plans to backport PhotoAccess to iOS 3.
